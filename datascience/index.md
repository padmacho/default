#Data Science

#Overview
The course aims at developing both math and programming skills required for a data scientist. It allows us to get insight into data analysis problems that arise in business verticals and solving those problems using statistical and machine learning approaches. The course also focus upon the understanding fundamental math underlying those models. This course is more of practical research oreinted course than developer oriented. It focuses on 6 most common data analysis problems that arise in most business verticals: Classification, Regression, Recommender Systems, Clustering, Association Analysis and Outlier Detection.

#Objectives
Upon successful completion of Data Science/Analytics course, participants will be able to:

* Understand and Apply how statistical data analysis techniques are utilized in business decision making
* Understand and Apply machine learning techniques in business data analysis
* Solve the data analysis use case from its inception to deployment on their own
* Apply algorithms to build machine intelligence

#Target Audience
Developers at all levels, BI professionals, DataWarehousing Professionals, Team Leads, Analytics Managers & Business Managers.

#Prerequisites
Nothing but passion & interest towards data engineering
