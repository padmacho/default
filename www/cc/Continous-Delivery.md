# Continuous Delivery
- Continuous Integration (CI) is a **development practice** that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a daily
- Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing team to detect problem early
- By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly and locate them more easily
- Real continuous integration has little or nothing to do with build servers

# History
- 1999 eXtreme Programming
- Kent Beck and Martin Fowler
- Extreme Programming Explained
    - The book that started the agile revolution
- A manual process

# Branching Rules
- Check in frequently
- Don't break the Build
    - Don't check-in broken or untested code
    - Or the beers are on you!
- Don't check-in if the build is broken
- Don't go home until your changes are built and verified
- If you must branch, ensure they are very **short lived**

# How do we reduce Lead-Time?
Lead time can be described more abstractly as the time elapsed between the identification of a requirement and its fulfillment. Defining a more concrete measurement depends on the situation being examined: for instance, when focusing on the software development process, the "lead time" elapsed between the formulation of a user story and that story being used "in production", that is, by actual users under normal conditions.
- Continuous Everything!
- Lean or agile
    - Reduce the cost of change
    - Development is not the only cost
