# Machine Learning
Building a model from example inputs to make data-driven predictions


# Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised
 -  In supervised learning, the output datasets are provided which are used to train the machine and get the desired outputs
 - Value prediction
 - Needs training data containing value being predicted
 - Trained model predicts value in new data
- Unsupervised
 -  In unsupervised learning no datasets are provided, instead the data is clustered into different classes .
 - Identify clusters of like data
 - Data does not contain cluster membership
 - Model provides access to data by cluster
