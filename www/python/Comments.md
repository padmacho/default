# Comments
Ideally, your code should be clean enough that ancillary explanation is not required. Nevertheless, it's sometimes necessary to explain why a particular approach has been chosen or a particular technique used. And we can do that using Python comments.

Comments in Python begin with a **hash symbol** and continue to the end of the line
# Example
```python
import sys
print("Welcome Mr ",sys.argv[1]) # The 0th arg is the module filename
```
