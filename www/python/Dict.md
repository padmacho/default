# Dictionaries
Dictionaries are completely fundamental to the way the Python language works and are very widely used. A dictionary **maps keys to values** and in some languages is known as an associate of array.
```python
{k1:v1,k2:v2}
```
Where k1,k2 are **keys** and v1,v2 are **values**
```python
>>> students={"bob":90,"tom":50,"ram":70} # Create a dictionary    
>>> students["ram"] # access by key                          
70                                            
>>> students["dora"]=30 # adds a new element in dictionary                      
>>> students
{'bob': 90, 'ram': 70, 'tom': 50, 'dora': 30}
```
# Note
- Be aware that the entries in the dictionary can't be relied upon to be stored in any particular order
