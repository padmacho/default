# Exception Handling
Exception handling is a mechanism for stopping normal program flow and continuing at some surrounding context or code block. The event of interrupting normal flow is called the act of raising an exception.

- Raise an exception to interrupt program flow
- Handle an exception to resume control
- Unhandled exceptions will terminate the program
- Exception objects contain information about the exceptional event.
