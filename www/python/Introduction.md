“The most visible (difference) is probably the way the “print” statement works. It's different enough that the same script won't be able to run on both versions at the same time, but pick one and you'll be fine.”

Essentially, the print statement has been replaced with a print () function.

Python 2
```Python
print "I am python 2"
```
Python 3
```Python
print("I am python 3")
```
