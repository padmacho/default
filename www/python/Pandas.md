# Pandas
- It is a powerful Python data analysis toolkit
- It provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with **relationa** or **labeled** data both easy and intuitive
# Why to use Pandas
- It has Intuitive data format
- Easy data transformations
- Data visualization

# import panda and numpy packages
```python

# Pandas and Numpy
There are several routines in Numpy that simplify working in Pandas, and you will see that very soon. Pandas and Numpy add several new data types, and there are three of them that are very good to be familiar with, since the very beginning of your adventure with Pandas

# Dataset and Basic Object
- A data set is a collection of related, discrete items of related data that may be accessed individually or in combination or managed as a whole entity.
- Basic objects
    - np.array - Numpy array-  it is a **function** to create an ndarray, it is not a class itself.
    - np.ndarray- Nd stands for n-dimensional, which means it can have arbitrary number of dimensions
    - pd.series - series that represents dataset with a single column
    - pd.DataFrame - Table like DataFrame format that represents multi column data
