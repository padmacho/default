# Relation Operators
Bool values are commonly produced by Python's relational operators, which can be used for comparing objects.

- ==  value equality
- !=  value inequality
- <   less-than
- \>   greater-than
- <=  less-than or equal to
- \>=  greater- than or equal to

```python
>>> i=10  
>>> i==10
True      
>>> i!=10
False     
>>> i<10  
False     
>>> i>10  
False     
>>> i<=10
True      
>>> i>=10
True      
>>>
```
